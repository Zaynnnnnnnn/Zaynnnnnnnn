Engineer with a focus on implementing the core mechanics behind trading and risk systems.

I build deterministic, testable software that models how financial platforms validate,
process, and analyse orders — prioritising transparency and maintainability over abstraction.

Key themes in my work include matching logic, exposure controls, reproducible simulations,
and structured data processing.

Always interested in improving performance, simplifying architecture, and writing software
that behaves predictably under pressure.
